amountPaid = 2000 * 40.00
Tara paid $80,000 for the stock.

comissionPaid = 80000 * .03
Tara paid her broker $2,400.

saleAmount = 2000 * 42.75
Tara sold for $85,500.

comissionPaid = 85500 * .03
Tara paid her broker another $2,565

85500 - 80000 = 5500
2400 + 2565 = 4965
5500 - 4965 = 535
535 > 0 == true
Tara did make a profit.
